# AB-Testing-Online-Website-w-Python
Personally, I have never found a comprehensive source online for A/B Testing which is FREE until Udacity published a great free course for A/B Testing.
This Python notebook is a walkthrough solution of my final project. 
The project aims at analyzing two different versions of Udacity website and determining which version of the website will bring more traffic or generate more revenue.
The project includes all the cool stuff that you only read about- choosing a metric, building intuition, defining hypothesis and comparing two samples for hypothesis testing

Little about the course,
It focuses on design and analysis of A/B tests. The course covers how to choose and characterize metrics to evaluate your experiments,
 how to design an experiment with enough statistical power and how to analyze the results and draw valid conclusions.
